# serious_python

Embedded Python runtime for Flutter apps.

## Platform Support

| iOS     |   Android   |

### Python versions

iOS version of plugin is based on [Kivy toolchain](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios) and currently uses Python 3.10.10.

## Usage

Import Serious Python package into your app:

`import 'package:serious_python/serious_python.dart';`

The plugin is built against iOS 12.0, so you might need to update iOS version in `ios/Podfile`:

```bash
# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '12.0'
```

Create an instance of `SeriousPython` class and call its `run()` method:

```dart
SeriousPython().run("app/app.zip");
```

`app/app.zip` is a path to asset archive with your Python app.

Add an asset path to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - app/app.zip
```

When the app starts the archive is unpacked to a temporary directory and Serious Python plugin will try to run `main.py` in the root of the archive. Current directory is changed to a temporary directory.

If your Python app has a different entry point it could be specified with `appFileName` parameter:

```dart
SeriousPython().run("app/app.zip", appFileName: "my_app.py");
```

You can pass a map with environment variables that should be available in your Python program:

```dart
SeriousPython().run("app/app.zip",
    appFileName: "my_app.py",
    environmentVariables: {"a": "1", "b": "2"});
```

By default, Serious Python expects Python dependencies installed into `__pypackages__` directory in the root of app directory. You can add additional paths to look for 3rd-party packages using `modulePaths` parameter:

```dart
SeriousPython().run("app/app.zip",
    appFileName: "my_app.py",
    modulePaths: ["/absolute/path/to/my/site-packages"]);
```

### Packaging Python app

To simplify the packaging of your Python app Serious Python provides a CLI which can be run with the following command:

```
dart run serious_python:main
```

There is `package` command which takes a directory with Python app as the first argument. The command must be run in Flutter app root directory, where `pubspec.yaml` is located. The path could be either relative or an absolute:

```
dart run serious_python:main package app/src
```

By default, the command creates `app/app.zip` asset, but you can change its path/name with `--asset` argument:

```
dart run serious_python:main package --asset assets/myapp.zip app/src
```

If there is `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` in the root of source directory `package` command will try to install dependencies to `__pypackages__` in the root of destination archive.

Make sure generated asset is added to `pubspec.yaml`.

## Python app structure

By default, embedded Python program is run in a separate thread, to avoid UI blocking. Your Flutter app is not supposed to directly call Python functions or modules, but instead it should communicate via some API provided by a Python app, such as: REST API, sockets, SQLite database, files, etc.

To constantly run on background a Python program must be blocking, for example a [Flask app](examples/flask_example) listening on `8000` port, or you can start your long-running computations in `threading.Thread` and use `threading.Event` to prevent program from exiting.

Synchronous execution of Python program is also supported with `sync: true` parameter to `SeriousPython().run()` method. For example, it could be a utility program doing some preperations, etc. Just make sure it's either very short or run in a Dart isolate to avoid blocking UI.

## Supported Python packages

All "pure" Python packages are supported. These are packages that implemented in Python only, without native extensions written in C, Rust or other low-level language.

For iOS: packages with native extensions having a [recipe](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/tree/master/kivy_ios/recipes) are supported. To use these packages you need to build a custom Python distributive for iOS (see below).
